# PathVGAE

Natural hazards such as wildfires, hurricanes, and floods can cause significant disruptions that can compromise the operational efficiency of the network components (e.g. roads and intersections). To model mobility responses to disruptions, it is important to understand the role of each road in facilitating the flow of traffic and in providing access to different parts of the network, which can be quantified through centrality measures. However, simulating disruptions typically requires recomputing centrality measures multiple times, which is computationally expensive and even infeasible for huge networks. To alleviate this issue, we propose a data efficient machine learning model called PathVGAE to learn to rank roads based on centrality given only the structure of the network. PathVGAE leverages a Variational Graph Autoencoder (VGAE) structure with a path sampling aggregation mechanism to learn patterns along paths through the network, which helps provide critical insights into a roadâ€™s role in facilitating movement and providing access routes. Experimental results show that our model outperforms baselines in the centrality-based road ranking task given little data, making it a potentially valuable tool for fast disruption vulnerability analysis.
